Design process:
Since the premise of our project was to create a modern looking interface for financial websites with some functionality for news, research, and notes pages, we decided to implement the industry standard modern web framwework called next.js, which is a React frammework. Next.js allows front-end developers to easily integrate modern web features by taking advantage of the large libraries that next.js has. As a result, we also took advantage and built our site with libraries to easily configure images, set up shading on our buttons and background, and configure navigation (for example, the icons found throughout our website are from React libraries). Specifically for styling, Tailwind CSS was the predomiminant library utilized. We used many of their premade, public components as a template to improve aesthetic in our front-end design. 

In order to get functionality related to stocks and news, we decided to use a financial API (Alpha Vantage) and financial news API (News API). However, currently, we are limited to 25 API calls per day as we are on a free plan. 

In the design of this project, we designed in a way that would make it simpler for a back-end developer to implement back-end functionality into the program. Next.js, node.js, and react.js were the primary components of making this project possible, and the combination of each allows for the development of both front-end and back-end. 


Our development process:

As stated earlier, this project is developed primarily with the Next.js framework. As two freshmens coming out of an introductory computer science class, we did not have any expertise in this framework and barely any experience with industry-standard front-end designs. This, unfortunately, resulted in us spending most of our time studying the Next.js framework, which ate away at time that could've been spent on further developing the application. This endeavor did, however, display that although CS50 didn't delve into industry-standard frameworks, it did teach us how to learn computer science efficiently, which is an extraordinarily valuable, life-long skill. This project gave us a foundation that can help us build stronger skills in the future.
