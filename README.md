Our project is basically a financial service website with a register page, log-in page, transfer funds page (to move funds from cash to stock account), transaction page (to buy/sell stocks), research page (to look up market values based on the stock symbol entered), news page (to look up news articles related to the stock symbol entered), and a notes page (that allows users to take notes on anything really but ideally trading strategies). 


When you first open the site, you will arive at the basic main page with two main buttons, Get Started and Register. By clicking on Register, you will arrive at the register page where you enter a username and password for your user account. From there, you can go to Log In and enter your username and password to enter the dashboard page of the website. The dashboard page has information about your portfolio and links to other pages (mentioned above).


To use our project, first download node.js(LTS via https://nodejs.org/en/download/). In the installer, agree to all of the terms and conditions and ensure that 'npm package manager' is being installed (highlight/check 'Automatically install the necessary tools...'). Once nodejs is fully installed, download the project files from github (zip is fine). Create a new folder on desktop, drag the zip file into it, and unzip the file there. Once files have been successfully extracted, open Visual Studio Code and open the new folder in Visual Studio Code. Once the folder is open, open the terminal (click terminal on the top of the screen and then open new terminal) and make sure that your file directory (cd) is in the app of the root folder (Robin50/app). Finally, run the command 'npm run dev' in the terminal, and a browser window should open with the website.
